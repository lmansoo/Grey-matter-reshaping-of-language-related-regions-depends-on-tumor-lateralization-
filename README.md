# General information
Welcome! This repository contains the developed scripts for the paper Grey matter reshaping of language-related regions depends on tumor location by Lucia Manso-Ortega, Laura de Frutos-Sagastuy, Manuel Carreiras, Sandra Gisbert-Muñoz, Joe Qiao, Patricia Walshaw, Ileana Quiñones and Monika M. Polczynska, result of a collaboration project between the University of California, Los Ángeles (USA) and the Basque center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL) (Spain).

PAPER + EXPLICAR PROCESO DE VBM (coger del script)

What is this repo or project? (You can reuse the repo description you used earlier because this section doesn’t have to be long.)

# How to execute?

Requisites before start: 
- If you need to unzip the images, a .txt file with the list of all the images you wish to unzip
- List of all the participants you are going to analyse saved as a txt file 
- Download SPM 
- Save the templates for each of the SPM modules in a 'Templates' folder 


## 


# Built with
For the development of this project, we have used the following softwares and toolboxes in the indicated versions:
- Matlab 2021B
- Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) toolbox in Matlab for the processing of the images. https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/
- Mricron software for creating the tumor masks
